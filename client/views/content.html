To the extent that ownership of your Works and the rights therein are not determined by contractual terms between Innov8s and you or your employer, the license terms below apply.

<h2>License</h2>

You grant to Innov8s and its designees, an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub- licensable, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty free license to use the Works and all of your rights therein, without payment or other consideration of any kind, or permission or notification, to you or any third party and without crediting you. The license shall include, without limitation, the irrevocable right to (i) publish, reproduce, prepare derivative works, combine with other works, alter, translate, distribute copies, display, perform, license the Works, or portions thereof, alone or with other material, with or without edits, without notice and without obligation, payment, accounting, or other reference or attribution to you or any other person, in the name of Innov8s or its designees throughout the world in perpetuity in any and all media now or hereafter known, without obtaining further permission from you or any third party and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export and make improvement upon any product or service described in the Works.

The license also permits Innov8s and its designees to use portions of the Works you submit, adapt, modify or rewrite any Works you submit, and/or incorporate other materials, either created by Innov8s and/or its designees or licensed from third parties, with the Works you submit. Any such works shall be deemed Works owned by Innov8s and shall not be subject to your approval or payment by Innov8s of any compensation to you.

Rights in the Works may include, without limitation, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights. The license applies whether or not the Works are or could be protected under applicable intellectual property laws, such as the Copyright, Trademark or Patent Laws of the United States, or those of other applicable countries.
